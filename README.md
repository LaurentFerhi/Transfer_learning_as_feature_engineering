# Transfer learning as a feature engineering mean
Transfer learning by using Alexnet convolutional layer as feature engineering. An intermediate csv is used to save convolutional layer pre-processing. The NN layers can then be replaced by another classifier. The training time is tremendously reduced for a very accurate result.
